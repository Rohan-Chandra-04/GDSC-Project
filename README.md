Description: This project was done as part of recruitment process of GDSC NITK.In this project, my backend will make
a request to GitHub GraphQL API to fetch the user's profile data and display it on the frontend using EJS templates.
Basically, in given task, I was asked to make a query request to Github Graphql API to fetch the details of particular 
Github user.So, whenever a client comes to my server and enters a Github username, he will get the details of his
recent repos.
